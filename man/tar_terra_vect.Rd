\arguments{
\item{name}{Symbol, name of the target. A target
name must be a valid name for a symbol in R, and it
must not start with a dot. Subsequent targets
can refer to this name symbolically to induce a dependency relationship:
e.g. \code{tar_target(downstream_target, f(upstream_target))} is a
target named \code{downstream_target} which depends on a target
\code{upstream_target} and a function \code{f()}. In addition, a target's
name determines its random number generator seed. In this way,
each target runs with a reproducible seed so someone else
running the same pipeline should get the same results,
and no two targets in the same pipeline share the same seed.
(Even dynamic branches have different names and thus different seeds.)
You can recover the seed of a completed target
with \code{tar_meta(your_target, seed)} and run \code{\link[targets:tar_seed_set]{tar_seed_set()}}
on the result to locally recreate the target's initial RNG state.}

\item{command}{R code to run the target.}

\item{pattern}{Language to define branching for a target.
For example, in a pipeline with numeric vector targets \code{x} and \code{y},
\code{tar_target(z, x + y, pattern = map(x, y))} implicitly defines
branches of \code{z} that each compute \code{x[1] + y[1]}, \code{x[2] + y[2]},
and so on. See the user manual for details.}

\item{filetype}{character. File format expressed as GDAL driver names passed
to \code{\link[terra:writeVector]{terra::writeVector()}}. See 'Note' for more details}

\item{gdal}{character. GDAL driver specific datasource creation options
passed to \code{\link[terra:writeVector]{terra::writeVector()}}.}

\item{zipfile}{logical. Should the file in the target store be a ZIP archive?
Required for \code{filetype} formats that have sidecar files. Not all GDAL
drivers support directly generating SOZip-enabled files. Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments not yet used}

\item{packages}{Character vector of packages to load right before
the target runs or the output data is reloaded for
downstream targets. Use \code{tar_option_set()} to set packages
globally for all subsequent targets you define.}

\item{tidy_eval}{Logical, whether to enable tidy evaluation
when interpreting \code{command} and \code{pattern}. If \code{TRUE}, you can use the
"bang-bang" operator \verb{!!} to programmatically insert
the values of global objects.}

\item{library}{Character vector of library paths to try
when loading \code{packages}.}

\item{repository}{Character of length 1, remote repository for target
storage. Choices:
\itemize{
\item \code{"local"}: file system of the local machine.
\item \code{"aws"}: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. Can be configured
with a non-AWS S3 bucket using the \code{endpoint} argument of
\code{\link[targets:tar_resources_aws]{tar_resources_aws()}}, but versioning capabilities may be lost
in doing so.
See the cloud storage section of
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/data.html}
for details for instructions.
\item \code{"gcp"}: Google Cloud Platform storage bucket.
See the cloud storage section of
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/data.html}
for details for instructions.
}

Note: if \code{repository} is not \code{"local"} and \code{format} is \code{"file"}
then the target should create a single output file.
That output file is uploaded to the cloud and tracked for changes
where it exists in the cloud. The local file is deleted after
the target runs.}

\item{iteration}{Character of length 1, name of the iteration mode
of the target. Choices:
\itemize{
\item \code{"vector"}: branching happens with \code{vctrs::vec_slice()} and
aggregation happens with \code{vctrs::vec_c()}.
\item \code{"list"}, branching happens with \verb{[[]]} and aggregation happens with
\code{list()}.
\item \code{"group"}: \code{dplyr::group_by()}-like functionality to branch over
subsets of a non-dynamic data frame.
For \code{iteration = "group"}, the target must not by dynamic
(the \code{pattern} argument of \code{\link[targets:tar_target]{tar_target()}} must be left \code{NULL}).
The target's return value must be a data
frame with a special \code{tar_group} column of consecutive integers
from 1 through the number of groups. Each integer designates a group,
and a branch is created for each collection of rows in a group.
See the \code{\link[targets:tar_group]{tar_group()}} function to see how you can
create the special \code{tar_group} column with \code{dplyr::group_by()}.
}}

\item{error}{Character of length 1, what to do if the target
stops and throws an error. Options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"stop"}: the whole pipeline stops and throws an error.
\item \code{"continue"}: the whole pipeline keeps going.
\item \code{"abridge"}: any currently running targets keep running,
but no new targets launch after that.
(Visit \url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/debugging.html}
to learn how to debug targets using saved workspaces.)
\item \code{"null"}: The errored target continues and returns \code{NULL}.
The data hash is deliberately wrong so the target is not
up to date for the next run of the pipeline.
}}

\item{memory}{Character of length 1, memory strategy.
If \code{"persistent"}, the target stays in memory
until the end of the pipeline (unless \code{storage} is \code{"worker"},
in which case \code{targets} unloads the value from memory
right after storing it in order to avoid sending
copious data over a network).
If \code{"transient"}, the target gets unloaded
after every new target completes.
Either way, the target gets automatically loaded into memory
whenever another target needs the value.
For cloud-based dynamic files
(e.g. \code{format = "file"} with \code{repository = "aws"}),
this memory strategy applies to the
temporary local copy of the file:
\code{"persistent"} means it remains until the end of the pipeline
and is then deleted,
and \code{"transient"} means it gets deleted as soon as possible.
The former conserves bandwidth,
and the latter conserves local storage.}

\item{garbage_collection}{Logical, whether to run \code{base::gc()}
just before the target runs.}

\item{deployment}{Character of length 1. If \code{deployment} is
\code{"main"}, then the target will run on the central controlling R process.
Otherwise, if \code{deployment} is \code{"worker"} and you set up the pipeline
with distributed/parallel computing, then
the target runs on a parallel worker. For more on distributed/parallel
computing in \code{targets}, please visit
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html}.}

\item{priority}{Numeric of length 1 between 0 and 1. Controls which
targets get deployed first when multiple competing targets are ready
simultaneously. Targets with priorities closer to 1 get dispatched earlier
(and polled earlier in \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}).}

\item{resources}{Object returned by \code{tar_resources()}
with optional settings for high-performance computing
functionality, alternative data storage formats,
and other optional capabilities of \code{targets}.
See \code{tar_resources()} for details.}

\item{storage}{Character of length 1, only relevant to
\code{\link[targets:tar_make_clustermq]{tar_make_clustermq()}} and \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}.
Must be one of the following values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"main"}: the target's return value is sent back to the
host machine and saved/uploaded locally.
\item \code{"worker"}: the worker saves/uploads the value.
\item \code{"none"}: almost never recommended. It is only for
niche situations, e.g. the data needs to be loaded
explicitly from another language. If you do use it,
then the return value of the target is totally ignored
when the target ends, but
each downstream target still attempts to load the data file
(except when \code{retrieval = "none"}).

If you select \code{storage = "none"}, then
the return value of the target's command is ignored,
and the data is not saved automatically.
As with dynamic files (\code{format = "file"}) it is the
responsibility of the user to write to
the data store from inside the target.

The distinguishing feature of \code{storage = "none"}
(as opposed to \code{format = "file"})
is that in the general case,
downstream targets will automatically try to load the data
from the data store as a dependency. As a corollary, \code{storage = "none"}
is completely unnecessary if \code{format} is \code{"file"}.
}}

\item{retrieval}{Character of length 1, only relevant to
\code{\link[targets:tar_make_clustermq]{tar_make_clustermq()}} and \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}.
Must be one of the following values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"main"}: the target's dependencies are loaded on the host machine
and sent to the worker before the target runs.
\item \code{"worker"}: the worker loads the targets dependencies.
\item \code{"none"}: the dependencies are not loaded at all.
This choice is almost never recommended. It is only for
niche situations, e.g. the data needs to be loaded
explicitly from another language.
}}

\item{cue}{An optional object from \code{tar_cue()} to customize the
rules that decide whether the target is up to date.}
}
\description{
Provides a target format for \link[terra:SpatVector-class]{terra::SpatVector} objects.
}
\note{
Although you may pass any supported GDAL vector driver to the
\code{filetype} argument, not all formats are guaranteed to work with
\code{geotargets}.  At the moment, we have tested \code{GeoJSON}, \verb{ESRI Shapefile},
\code{GPKG}, and \code{Parquet} which all appear to work generally. \verb{ESRI Shapefile}
targets are always stored as a SOZip-enabled ZIP file (GDAL >= 3.7). \code{GPKG}
and \code{Parquet} can optionally be stored as ZIP files by setting \code{zipfile=TRUE}.
